CI/CD Pipeline with Packer, GitHub Actions, Docker, and Terraform This repository contains a CI/CD pipeline designed to automate the process of building, containerizing, and deploying a Java application on a multi-AZ (Availability Zone) cloud infrastructure. The entire infrastructure is provisioned using Terraform.

Project Overview The CI/CD pipeline includes the following stages:

Base Image Creation:

Utilize Packer to create a base image. The base image is configured with necessary dependencies and configurations for the Java application. Continuous Integration (CI):

Implement GitHub Actions for CI. Automate testing and building of the Java application upon code changes. Containerization:

Containerize the Java application using Docker. Ensure the application is ready for deployment by packaging it into a Docker image. Deployment:

Push the Docker image to a Docker registry. Deploy the Docker container to a multi-AZ cloud infrastructure. Infrastructure Provisioning:

Provision and manage the cloud infrastructure using Terraform. Ensure high availability and scalability by deploying across multiple availability zones. Key Components Packer: Automates the creation of a base image with all necessary dependencies. GitHub Actions: Handles the CI pipeline, including testing and building the Java application. Docker: Containerizes the Java application to ensure consistent deployment across environments. Terraform: Manages the provisioning of cloud infrastructure. Ensures infrastructure as code, facilitating reproducibility and scalability. Workflow Packer Build:

Define a Packer template to create a base image. The image includes necessary tools and configurations for the Java application. GitHub Actions CI:

Trigger CI pipeline on code push or pull request. Run automated tests to ensure code quality. Build the Java application into a Docker image. Docker Containerization:

Build and tag the Docker image. Push the Docker image to a Docker registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR). Terraform Provisioning:

Define Terraform configurations to set up cloud infrastructure. Apply Terraform configurations to provision resources across multiple AZs. Deploy the Docker container to the provisioned infrastructure. Getting Started Clone the Repository:

sh Copy code git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git cd your-repo Setup Packer:

Install Packer. Configure your Packer template in the packer/ directory. Setup GitHub Actions:

Configure GitHub Actions workflows in the .github/workflows/ directory. Build and Push Docker Image:

Ensure Docker is installed and running. Use provided Dockerfiles to build and push the Docker image. Provision Infrastructure with Terraform:

Install Terraform. Configure Terraform scripts in the terraform/ directory. Apply Terraform configurations to provision cloud resources. Contributing We welcome contributions! Please fork the repository, make your changes, and open a pull request.
